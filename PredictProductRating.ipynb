    "# Predict Product Ratings from reviews\n",
    "This is a classic NLP problem dealing with data from an e-commerce store focusing on women's clothing. Each record in the dataset is a customer review which consists of the review title, text description and a rating (ranging from 1 - 5) for a product amongst other features\n",
